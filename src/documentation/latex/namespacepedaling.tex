Documentation for this module. 

Control of Roboys\textquotesingle{} hip, knees and feet for pedaling. In order to reach the requested bike-\/velocity, we compute correspondent angular-\/velocity for the pedals. The circulation is ideally divided into @\+N\+U\+M\+B\+E\+R\+\_\+\+C\+I\+R\+C\+U\+L\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+P\+O\+I\+N\+TS trajectory points represented by angles within the circulation circle (pedal-\/angle). With angle-\/difference between two points and angular-\/velocity we use the correspondent transition time to control the joints in order to create a pedaling motion for Roboy.

For every joint, we use cubic spline interpolation of pre-\/captured set points with pedal\+\_\+angle as input to receive continuous function to be able to get the corresponding joint-\/angle for every pedal-\/angle. This enables to use joint-\/angle-\/difference between two trajectory-\/points and transition time to compute and apply velocity-\/control to the joint-\/angles to create pedaling-\/motion

In order to decrease and hopefully erase velocity-\/error, we multiply the computed (ideal) velocity with an error-\/factor which is computed and dependent on the velocity-\/error of previous transitions and measured by pedal-\/angle-\/error
