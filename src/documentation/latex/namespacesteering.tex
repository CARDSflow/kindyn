\subsection{Detailed Description}
Documentation for this module. 

Control of Roboys\textquotesingle{} shoulders, elbows and wrists for steering. In order to reach the requested steering-\/angle we target intermediate points between the current and the requested steering-\/angle to ensure Roboys\textquotesingle{} hands are following the captured steering-\/trajectory.

In order to target a point on the steering-\/trajectory for the hands, we use an interpolation-\/function for the joint angles with steering-\/angle as input that uses precomputed set-\/points of all joint-\/angles according to a certain steering-\/angle.
